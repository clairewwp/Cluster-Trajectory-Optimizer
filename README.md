# Data Analyst for Trajectory Data
The project aims to explore the optimization of different Density-Based Clustering Methods to evaluate the aggregation of observed paths from trajectories

# 
# Density-Based Clustering methods used:
- DBSCAN
- OPTICS
- HDBSCAN
# Centroid-Based Clustering method used:
- K-means
